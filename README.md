**_THERMAL VIDEO ANALISYS_** 

This is a prototipe using a fluke thermal camera for a system to detect people with high temperature focused to prevent the coronavirus spread in a factory.
Since the pandemic started, a lot of developers are working on it. I still can´t upload the project but i´ll be happy to help if you want to develop something like this.
